This is a puzzle escape game.
You can clear the stage using mouse and keyboard input.
Adjusting the size of the sound can prevent you from being surprised.
Also, do not play if you have an elderly, pregnant, or heart disease 
because it contains bizarre or scary elements everywhere.
There are various interactions using mice throughout the stage, 
so please use them well.
Hints are also located on the left side of each stage, 
so look at the hint and clear it
